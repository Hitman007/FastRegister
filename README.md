One of the problems with wordpress is the registration process. Which goes:

1. Go to the registration form
2. Send user a random password based on their email
3. Make the user retrieve the email, copy and paste it then go back to the site
4. Log in
5. Change their password.

This method DOES in fact force the user to prove they own the email account. But what if you don't care about that? What if you just want to log themin without forcing them to confirm the email. There are many reasons to want this.
